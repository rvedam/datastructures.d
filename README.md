# datastructures.d

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive list of data structures,
written in the D programming language (http://dlang.org) for the purposes of 
study as well as usage in applications. The data structures themselves will 
have a common interface and will be generally categorized by the internal 
representation of their contents. Additionally, a list of common examples
are provided for the purpose of studying how each data structure is used, along 
with potential trade-offs to consider when deciding what representation to use.
